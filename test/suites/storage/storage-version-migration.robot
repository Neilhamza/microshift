Storage Version Migration Test

*** Keywords ***
Setup
    [Documentation]    Create initial setup with CRD and resources
    Check Required Env Variables
    Login MicroShift Host
    Setup Kubeconfig

    Create Beta CRD
    # There may be a lag between creating the CRD and being able to
    # use it, so retry uploading the first copy of the resource a few
    # times.
    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    5x    10s

Teardown
    [Documentation]    Delete all created resources

Create Beta CRD
    [Documentation]    Create beta CRD
    Run With Kubeconfig    oc apply -f ${BETA_CRD}

Create Custom Resource
    [Documentation]    Create beta version resource
    Run With Kubeconfig    oc apply -f ${CR_RESOURCE}

Update Beta CRD To Stable
    [Documentation]    Update the beta versin of CRD to stable
    Run With Kubeconfig    oc apply -f ${STABLE_CRD}

Validate Migration
    [Documentation]    Validate that a migration resource was created the CRD,
    ...    we should expect to see a StorageState and StorageVersionMigration resource created.
    ...    With in the Migration and State objects we should see the correct version and object
    ...    hash defined. Storage hash is a trimmed base64 encoded value of the APIResource, it
    ...    should be consistant per CRD structure.
    [Arguments]    ${api_version}    ${hash}
    ${yaml_data}=    Oc Get    migrates.test.resource    ""    default
    ${storage_yaml_data}=    Oc Get    storagestates.migration.k8s.io    ""    migrates.test.resource
    ${migration_json_text}=    Run With Kubeconfig
    ...    oc get storageversionmigration -o jsonpath="{.items[?(@.spec.resource.group=='test.resource')]}"
    ${migration_json_data}=    Json Parse    ${migration_json_text}
    Should Be Equal    ${yaml_data.apiVersion}    test.resource/${api_version}
    Should Be Equal    ${storage_yaml_data.status.currentStorageVersionHash}    ${hash}

Delete Migration Resources
